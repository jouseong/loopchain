# Loopchain

 Loopchain is a high-performance Blockchain Consensus & Network engine of ICON project.

 In order to run a loopchain node, you need to install [ICON Service](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-service) that runs a smart contract and interacts with loopchain engine, and [ICON RPC Server](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-rpc-server) that processes HTTP requests from clients. For details, refer to the guide below.

## Installation

### Requirements

Loopchain development and execution requires following environments.

* OS: MacOS, Linux
  * Windows are not supported yet.

* Python

  * Python 3.6.5+ (recommended version, 3.7 is not supported)
  
    Optional) We recommend to create an isolated Python 3 virtual environment with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).
    
    ```bash
    $ virtualenv -p python3 venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

* Third party tools
        
    ```
    automake pkg-config libtool leveldb rabbitmq openssl
    ```

    If you're using package manager, you can install all of them through your package manager.
    
    MacOS, for example)
    
    ```bash
    $ brew install automake pkg-config libtool leveldb rabbitmq openssl
    $ brew services start rabbitmq
    ```

* Check all requirements are installed and started properly

    ```bash
    $ make requirements
    ```

    If you don't see any error logs and you have started rabbitmq server, you may move on to next step.

### Install necessary packages

```bash
$ make install
```

### Setup

```bash
$ make setup  # type your password
```

This command is for setting up:
* generates python gRPC code from protocol buffer which is defined in `loopchain.proto`
* generates keystore through tbears for citizen node. **Please be careful not to forget the password since you will need it to run Citizen Node later.**

## Run Citizen Node on ICON network

* [Run Citizen Node on ICON Testnet network](docs/5.%20run/run_citizen_node.md#run-citizen-node-on-icon-testnet-network)
* [Run Citizen Node on ICON Mainnet network](docs/5.%20run/run_citizen_node.md#run-citizen-node-on-icon-mainnet-network)


#### Clean Up

* clear rabbitMQ processes & pycache & build

```bash
$ make clean
```

* delete log / delete DB

```bash
$ make clean-db
```
